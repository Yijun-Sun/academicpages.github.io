I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Communication at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and a Ph.D. fellow of CRC Media of Cooperation at the Univeristy of Siegen. 

My research revolves around a broad spectrum of mediatic technologies that shape the interaction between humans and the external world, thereby sustaining social reality. I am currently working on my dissertation project, “Media Vessels: An Archaeology of Electronic Media,” based on three years of archival research conducted at the National Museum of American History, the Library of Congress, the National Archives at Boston, the AT&T Archives and History Center, the Hagley Museum & Library, and History San Jose, among others. I examine the history of electronic media, with an emphasis on a feminist technology—the container––in the formation of media reality between humans and hardware. This research has earned support from the CRC Media of Cooperation at the University of Siegen, the Hagley Museum & Library, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. 

My other projects include they way human bodies were positioned within the physical and biological modalities of media design during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In a paper I publised in Cultural Critique, I explored the positioning of human bodies within the optical dynamics of ninteenth-century architectural spaces, examining the interplay between surveillance, spectatorship, and the fusion of subject-object roles within the operation of communities.

I hold an MA in Communication from Beijign Normal University and a BA in Communication and History from Beijign Normal University.
