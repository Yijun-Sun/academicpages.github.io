Do media impact us? In what ways? To what extent? With what consequences?
This course explores these questions, among others. We will investigate various approaches utilized to determine if, when, and how media influence viewers, listeners, readers, and users. Along the way, we will learn about and discuss prominent theories, concepts, and social issues with which media effects researchers grapple.
Some of the questions we will consider include:
• What does it mean to grow up in a media saturated society?
• How does television violence impact society and individuals?
• Do images of race, class, gender, and sexuality in television, films, and advertisements
influence our sense of self and others?
• Does mainstream news coverage create a more or less informed citizenry?
• What role does entertainment play in shaping our understanding of the world around
us?
• How have new media technologies transformed daily life?

The goal of this course is to expose students to theories, concepts, and empirical research that attempt to answer such questions. It also aims to instill the desire to better understand and explain the significance of media as cultural objects, texts, technologies, and practices in societies. The quest for such knowledge is often indispensable to many career paths and professions chosen by communication majors.
