Have you ever wondered how artificial intelligence has shaped our past, present, and future? In this course, we will take on a journey through the history of AI, discussing its multifaceted nature from three distinctive angles: technical development, philosophical underpinnings, and societal repercussions. From its inception to its contemporary prominence, we will discuss the mysteries of AI, exploring its evolution through the lens of theories of technology. Along the way, we will traverse the intertwined history of robotics and AI decision-making, the milestones in algorithm development, the representation of AI in popular culture, and questions of bias and social justice in AI practice today.
